Yesterday's experiments brought me to an unexpected perspective of the project. Until now I hadn't given much importance to designing some sort of art installation, as I couldn't see anything special as of the experience that that could bring. But now I realized that offering an Android app would open an interesting possibility. In an exhibition space, visitors could control the installation using their own smartphone.

Here is what I wrote down yesterday in my sketchbook after writing my blog post:

Text:

> Visitors can download an app and interact with their own device.

> This, opposed as to having another (single) device as an installation in the space, which could only be used by one person at a time.

> Many people could play at the same time. (and see how their different actions interfere)

And this is a more elaborated concept sketch that I just did today:

Actually, I would like to give as many open possibilities as possible. A touchscreen device would be available next to an explanation of the project, but the visitors could also install the app either by manually visiting certain URL or by reading a QR code. On the other hand, the app could be hosted on the Internet and/or in the local network (the visitors would need to connect to the local network to effectively experience the installation anyway. Thus, ideally the access to this network would be open, to make things easier).

This would also introduce new tweaks into the remote control app: the controls should have reverse feedback, i.e, should listen to value changes in the network and get updated accordingly. And what would happen if different visitors gave different values to the same control at the same time? I think interpolating the different values would be a good option, and to the user it would feel like forces competing against each other...
