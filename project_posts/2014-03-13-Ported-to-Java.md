Currently, the application takes some random decisions at startup. Instead of that, I would like the viewer to manipulate all those currently random parameters in real time. With Processing, it's relatively simple to do real-time communication through ["Open Sound Control"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) --but not in Coffeescript/JavaScript AFAIK.

So... I just ported my sketch to Java.

Tomorrow, I'll start coding that controller interface. In the future, it could be hardware based, but not for now...
