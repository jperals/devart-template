Until now, I've been using the remote control app from the same computer as the visuals app. It was about time to give inter-machine communication a try.

First, I managed to run the controller app on a GNU/Linux tablet PC. I liked the size, but I was courious to see whether it would work on Android too, so the next step would be in that direction.

Despite some obligatory tweaks (screen resolution, IP addresses, app permissions), running an Android version of the controller app was quite straightforward. These tweaks can be found on the branch "android-320x480" of this repo.

This (unfortunately rather amateur) video shows how it is to use a small Android smartphone to create Serendipity with our app.

To record this video I found myself kind of designing a choreography. I guess this is starting to become a live visual instrument...
