I would love that other people try my project for themselves, so here come the instructions to do so. It's nothing complicated IMO anyway, but just in case.

## Basics

The project currently consists of two Processing sketches which live inside the "processing" directory. One is called "serendipiter" and the other "tweaker". So, with Processing, we need to open the files "serendipiter/serendipiter.pde" and "tweaker/tweaker.pde" respectively.

## Dependencies

We need to install these libraries before running the sketches: controlP5. gifAnimation, netP5, oscP5.

## Running the app(s)

"Serendipiter" can actually run standalone. It will generate all the parameters that it needs randomly on load. One could just manually tweak the initialization of those parameters in the "Options" tab. But those values would stay for the whole execution, and it's not so fun. That's where "tweaker" comes in.

"serendipiter" and "tweaker" are aimed to be executed on parallel, either on the same device or two or more different ones. They communicate with each other via OpenSoundControl. Take a look at the "config" tab of each of the two sketches. In the master branch, the two sketches will run locally, if we don't change anything. But by tweaking these values, we are able to run them separately on different devices through a network, if we want. This is actually what we do in the Android version --but we'll get into that later.

## The "tweaker"

When we start "tweaker", it will connect to "serendipiter" automatically if it's running at the provided IP address, and it will intialize the controls to the current values. If not, it will show only the "connect" button, that we have to press once "serendipiter" is ready.

Once connected, this is how "tweaker" currently looks like (yes, there is room for improvement here):

The controls refer to the following parameters:

- "Artifacts": number of artifacts that "serendipiter" will work with.
- "Reset": delete the current artifacts and create them anew, while keeping the current parameters.
- "Attraction": how much each artifact will feel attracted to its nearest neighbour. Negative values will make them repel each other.
- "Inertia": whether the artifacts will have inertial movements, i.e, the attraction will affect their acceleration, or it will move heir position directly otherwise.
- "Points": draw one point at the center of each artifact.
- "Lines": draw a line from each artifact to its nearest neighbour.
- "Delaunay": draw a [Delaunay triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation)
- "Voronoi": draw a [Voronoi diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_tessellation)
- "Trace": leave a trace, i.e., don't clear the previous frame at each iteration
- "Polygons": Number of concentrical polygons to draw for each Voronoi cell.
- A color picker for the background color.
- The connect button.

## On Android

"Tweaker" can be run on Android. For that, there is a branch called "android-320x480" (for now, to try it on devices with screens larger than 320x480, using the Processing [scale()](http://processing.org/reference/scale_.html) function inside draw() can do the trick). All we will need to do is (in this order) switch to that branch, open the sketch on Processing, tweak the "remoteNetAddress" variable in the "config" tab to match the IP address of the machine on which "serendipiter" will be running... and run!

## Saving screenshots

There used to be the possibility of saving screenshots (and animations) even from "tweaker", but it has been sacrificed in the latest commits in favour of simultaneous multi-device support. Now, to save screenshots we have to do it from "serendipiter" and we can do it in three ways:

- Pressing "s" will save a screenshots in PNG format.
- Pressing "g" will start recording frames to generate an animated GIF using the GifAnimation library, and pressing "g" again will stop recording and save the resulting GIF file on the files system.
- Pressing "p" will start saving frames in PNG format, and pressing it again will stop. [Using Imagemagick](http://askubuntu.com/questions/43763/tool-to-convert-a-sequence-of-numbered-png-files-to-an-animated-gif) afterwards to generate a GIF out of a sequence of PNG files turned out to have better results than using GifAnimation.

For both Gif and PNG sequence recording, the variable options.exportFrameDelay is used to determine the number of frames delayed between each recorded frame.

Have fun!
