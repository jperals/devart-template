This project is not called "Serendipiter" without a reason. One of its main goals was provoking surprising, unexpected results, and I actually think that (even if it has to be outside the scope of this contest) the next steps have to be in that direction. More crazy stuff, less predictable algorithms, more abstract, less puropseful variables and objects...

Anyway, let's end this part of the journey by sharing a couple of examples of "accidents" that I have come with during this time.

At some point I realized that using triangles to draw polygons was much faster than using Processing's PShape class. But this is what happened when I forgot to draw the last triangle in the loop...

...And this is what I got when I somehow used the wrong values to scale the concentrical polygons of the Voronoi cells.

Here, a screenshot that I saved rather accidentally but then I found curious how it reminds me of a hand-written piece of paper...
